The buildNav functions dynamically creates a navigation bar out of sections found in the HTML code. the navigation bar is made of links in a list. When a navbar link is clicked, the page scrolls smoothly to the section.

The setActive function adds a class to the section and navbar links to highlight the section in the navigation bar that is in view on the page while scrolling the page.
